      <div class='description project'>My transition into the full-stack development career first started in early 2022 during my fifteenth year of teaching mathematics in public education. Covid impacted every aspect of our lives; particularly the education sector. Many teachers were forced to utilize websites and applications without any training, direction, guidance, or support. It was during this time that I decided to explore my passion for technology. I registered for courses through codecademy as well as earned a PMP through Google's Coursera and a certificate from ISTE in AI explorations and Their Practical Use in School Environments.</div>
